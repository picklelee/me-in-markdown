## Introduction

Hello! My name is picklelee and I hope your day was amazing. I am a student that loves playing video games like csgo (counter strike). I also enjoy playing basketball with friends. 

Whenever I have free time, I like to go outside and play basketball with my friends. When I feel lazy, I jut rot on my bead and doom scroll on tiktok or instagram reels. I also like to watch movies on netflix and tv shows. My favorite thing to do however is eat and take naps afterwards. Some people say to not eat and lay down afterwards but for me it is relaxing and I love doing it escpecially if it's ater school or a long day of playing basketball.

One game I really enjoy is CSGO also known as Counter Strike. I started playing this game 2 - 3 years ago and I fell in love with it. I started playing when there was no CS2 and it was the original first game. My friend told me to get this game on Stream since it was free. I listened to him because I played Valorant before and I heard that CS was basically the same thing. I wasn't that into CSGO at first but then they made CS2. Counter Strike 2 was a upgraded version and was more realistic. I ended up playing a lot and eventually got pretty good. I started dominating competitve games with my friend who told me about Counter Strike in the first place.

My goals within the 4 years of highschool is to play varsity basketball at Chatsworth Charter High School. The reason why this is my goal is because I feel like basketball can take me far in life. What I mean by this is maybe I could get scholarships in college or even make the NBA. These two options would either help out my parents because they save money from me going to college or it will help me make millions of dollars to provide for my family. Obviously my long term goal for life would be to make the NBA so that I could help my parents out so much that they won't have to work a day in their life.
